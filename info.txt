What works:
    - HQ
    - Drone's distance from HQ, Delivery Point and Dust Devils;

What doesn't:
    - Routing (I though I had a solution. I didn't.)
    - Anything that specifically required the API 

What works in a convoluted way (and why):
    - Drone's movement (you have to have your last click be on the button bound to the functions)
    - Drone's battery (same as Dust Devils);
    - Dust Devils (they only update every minute if you click on a button because ANY timer/interval broke the stupid arrays)
    - The Map (sometimes it just goes blank and you might have to restart the app. absolute headache)

What needs to be updated for the API's working:
    - Login
    - Customer Locations (it currently works for one delivery at a time, I can modify that if doing multiple at a time)

What's left:
    - CSS
    - Improving the Useropts, OperOpts and Intro pages

Routing pages [you can add the /whatever to the url to see the pages]:
    - Main Page (contains intro and login) [/main]
        -> Customer Page (contains useropts and map with is_op as false) [/user]

        -> Operator Page (contains operopts) [/op]
            -> Map Page (contains map with is_op as true) [/map]
